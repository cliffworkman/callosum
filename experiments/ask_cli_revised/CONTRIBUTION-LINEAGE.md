# Contribution lineage — semantic answer-sufficiency architecture

Follows [Credit the lineage](../../.claude/CREDIT-THE-LINEAGE.md): this architecture is not an
implementation of an identifiable external scholarly method or tool (`sufficiency_authoring.py`'s
own docstring is explicit that q_aib's contract content is Cliff's own researcher authorship, not
derived from a published method), but it has a real, worth-preserving internal contribution
lineage across a founder, a founder-plus-model design collaboration, and a model-driven
implementation pass. Recorded here rather than collapsed into a generic "AI-assisted" credit line.

**Researcher origin / disposition (Cliff Workman).** Defined the scientific objective,
generalizability priority, researcher-authorized semantic supersessions, and decisions governing
what sufficiency should mean and when model-assisted recovery may become authoritative.

**Elaboration / critique (Cliff Workman + ChatGPT).** Developed and stress-tested the generic
semantic-sufficiency architecture, including relational binding, semantic-vs-search state,
quantifier/completion semantics, model-signal boundaries, evidence-admissibility distinctions, and
generalization controls.

**Planning / implementation (Claude).** Performed code-grounded planning and implemented the
accepted architecture, including deterministic mapping, replay/testing infrastructure, and the
model-assisted nomination diagnostic seam.
